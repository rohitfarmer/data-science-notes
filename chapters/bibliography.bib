abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of information across datasets.},

@article{Melchiotti2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.Manual gating has been traditionally applied to cytometry data sets to identify cells based on protein expression. The advent of mass cytometry allows for a higher number of proteins to be simultaneously measured on cells, therefore providing a means to define cell clusters in a high dimensional expression space. This enhancement, whilst opening unprecedented opportunities for single cell-level analyses, makes the incremental replacement of manual gating with automated clustering a compelling need. To this aim many methods have been implemented and their successful applications demonstrated in different settings. However, the reproducibility of automatically generated clusters is proving challenging and an analytical framework to distinguish spurious clusters from more stable entities, and presumably more biologically relevant ones, is still missing. One way to estimate cell clusters' stability is the evaluation of their consistent re-occurrence within- and between-algorithms, a metric that is commonly used to evaluate results from gene expression. Herein we report the usage and importance of cluster stability evaluations, when applied to results generated from three popular clustering algorithms - SPADE, FLOCK and PhenoGraph - run on four different data sets. These algorithms were shown to generate clusters with various degrees of statistical stability, many of them being unstable. By comparing the results of automated clustering with manually gated populations, we illustrate how information on cluster stability can assist towards a more rigorous and informed interpretation of clustering results. We also explore the relationships between statistical stability and other properties such as clusters' compactness and isolation, demonstrating that whilst cluster stability is linked to other properties it cannot be reliably predicted by any of them. Our study proposes the introduction of cluster stability as a necessary checkpoint for cluster interpretation and contributes to the construction of a more systematic and standardized analytical framework for the assessment of cytometry clustering results.},

Although this provides a wealth of information, it becomes infeasible to analyze these datasets manually. When using 2D scatter plots, the number of possible plots increases exponentially with the number of markers and therefore, relevant information that is present in the data might be missed. In this article, we introduce a new visualization technique, called FlowSOM, which analyzes Flow or mass cytometry data using a Self-Organizing Map. Using a two-level clustering and star charts, our algorithm helps to obtain a clear overview of how all markers are behaving on all cells, and to detect subsets that might be missed otherwise.

Towards addressing this question, recent studies using vaccination as a model perturbation and systems-biology approaches are beginning to provide a glimpse of how natural population variation together with multiplexed, high-throughput measurement and computational analysis can be used to uncover predictors of immune response quality in humans.

abstract = {The advent of mass cytometry has led to an unprece-dented increase in the number of analytes measured in individual cells, thereby increasing the complexity and in-formation content of cytometric data. Although this tech-nology is ideally suited to the detailed examination of the immune system, the applicability of the different methods for analyzing such complex data is less clear. Conven-tional data analysis by manual gating of cells in biaxial dot plots is often subjective, time consuming, and ne-glectful of much of the information contained in a highly dimensional cytometric dataset. Algorithmic data mining has the promise to eliminate these concerns, and several such tools have been applied recently to mass cytometry data. We review computational data mining tools that have been used to analyze mass cytometry data, outline their differences, and comment on their strengths and limitations. This review will help immunologists to iden-tify suitable algorithmic tools for their particular proj-ects. The Journal of Immunology, 2015, 195: 773–779. S ingle-cell cytometry techniques permit phenotypic and functional analyses of large numbers of individual im-mune cells and have provided numerous insights into basic, translational, and clinical immunology. Historically, soft-ware facilitating manual gating via biaxial plots and bar graphs has been the predominant platform for exploring cytometry data. In " manual " gating, cell subsets of interest are identified from parent populations via visual inspection of dot plots displaying individual cells' fluorescence intensities. Despite considerable efforts to harmonize immunophenotyping and gating strategies for multicenter studies (1), this approach suffers from individual user bias when delineating population boundaries and requires prior knowledge of the cell type of interest. The increasing efforts in systems-level immunology and biomarker-driven research are not well served by this historical approach alone. Analyses by manual gating focus on specific populations, which often rep-resent only a fraction of the total information contained in a cytometric dataset (2). Relationships between populations can be overlooked and because biases and a priori knowledge dictate analysis, discovery of meaningful, but yet undefined, populations is difficult. Additionally, manual gating is not scalable; as the number of parameters increases, analyzing higher-dimensional data by manual gating quickly becomes impractical. The advent of mass cytometry enables the measurement of an unprecedented number of parameters. Single-cell analyses of . 40 parameters are now feasible (3, 4). However, the com-plexity of mass cytometry data complicates analysis: to visually analyze all combinations for a 40-parameter dataset would necessitate examining 780 two-dimensional dot plots. Clearly, manual gating alone is insufficient for exploring the full com-plexity of mass cytometry data in systematic and exhaustive ways. In response to the limitations of manual gating, the last decade has witnessed the development and application of computational methods to analyze cytometry data. Most existing algorithms for flow cytometry data analysis automatically identify cell pop-ulations based on unsupervised clustering according to their marker expression profiles, allowing an unbiased investigation of cytometry data (5). Beyond that, some algorithms provide the capacity to identify rare populations, match cell populations across samples, and statistically compare features between dif-ferent populations (6–8). Once established, workflows that in-clude algorithmic analyses are less labor intensive than manual gating and can consider multidimensional relationships within the data. Algorithms also provide an unsupervised analysis, allowing an unbiased investigation of cytometry data. Although unsupervised data analysis can be useful to identify aberrations of the immune system without knowing the target phenotype, the success of the approach still depends on the chosen analytes for an experiment and the quality of the input data. In this review, computational approaches are divided into dimensionality-reduction techniques, clustering-based analyses, and a trajectory detection algorithm (Table I). Although we have not tried to compare the algorithms in a direct competition, example outputs of the most accessible algorithms are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. Despite the applicability of many previ-ously developed algorithms to mass cytometry data, we focus on algorithms that have been explicitly applied to mass cytometry},

abstract = {Recent technological developments in high-dimensional flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) have made it possible to detect expression levels of dozens of protein markers in thousands of cells per second, allowing cell populations to be characterized in unprecedented detail. Traditional data analysis by "manual gating" can be inefficient and unreliable in these high-dimensional settings, which has led to the development of a large number of automated analysis methods. Methods designed for unsupervised analysis use specialized clustering algorithms to detect and define cell populations for further downstream analysis. Here, we have performed an up-to-date, extensible performance comparison of clustering methods for high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry data. We evaluated methods using several publicly available data sets from experiments in immunology, containing both major and rare cell populations, with cell population identities from expert manual gating as the reference standard. Several methods performed well, including FlowSOM, X-shift, PhenoGraph, Rclusterpp, and flowMeans. Among these, FlowSOM had extremely fast runtimes, making this method well-suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large, high-dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop computer. These results extend previously published comparisons by focusing on high-dimensional data and including new methods developed for CyTOF data. R scripts to reproduce all analyses are available from GitHub (https://github.com/lmweber/cytometry-clustering-comparison), and pre-processed data files are available from FlowRepository (FR-FCM-ZZPH), allowing our comparisons to be extended to include new clustering methods and reference data sets. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

The $\beta$-lactam class of antibiotics is one of the most important structural classes of antibacterial compounds and act by inhibiting the bacterial D ,D - transpeptidases that are responsible for the final step of peptidoglycan cross-linking. Our main aim in the study is to screen possible inhibitors against AmpC / $\beta$ - lactamase (an enzyme responsible for antimicrobial activity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa), through virtual screening of 1364 NCI (National Cancer Institute) diversity set II compounds. Homology Model of AmpC / $\beta$ - lactamase was constructed using MODELLER and the Model was validated using PROCHECK and Verify 3D programs to obtain a stable structure, which was further used for virtual screening of NCI (National Cancer Institute) diversity set II compounds through molecular Docking studies using Autodock. The amino acid sequence of the $\beta$ - lactamase was also subjected to ScanProsite web server to find any pattern present in the sequence. After the prediction of 3-dimensional model of AmpC/ $\beta$-lactamase, the possible Active sites of$\beta$ - lactamase were determined using LIGSITE(csc) and CastP web servers simultaneously. The Docked complexes were validated and Enumerated based on the Autodock Scoring function to pick out the best inhibitor based on Autodock energy score. Thus from the entire 1364 NCI diversity set II compounds which were Docked, the best four docking solutions were selected (ZINC12670903, ZINC17465965, ZINC11681166 and ZINC13099024). Further the Complexes were analyzed through LIGPLOT for their interaction for the 4 best docked NCI diversity set II compounds. Thus from the Complex scoring and binding ability it is deciphered that these NCI diversity set II compounds could be promising inhibitors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa using AmpC /$\beta$ - lactamase as Drug target yet pharmacological studies have to confirm it.},

abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite that can infect a wide range of warm-blooded animals including humans. In humans and other intermediate hosts, toxoplasma develops into chronic infection that cannot be eliminated by host's immune response or by currently used drugs. In most cases, chronic infections are largely asymptomatic unless the host becomes immune compromised. Thus, toxoplasma is a global health problem and the situation has become more precarious due to the advent of HIV infections and poor toleration of drugs used to treat toxoplasma infection, having severe side effects and also resistance have been developed to the current generation of drugs. The emergence of these drug resistant varieties of T. gondii has led to a search for novel drug targets. We have performed a comparative analysis of metabolic pathways of the host Homo sapiens and the pathogen T. gondii. The enzymes in the unique pathways of T. gondii, which do not show similarity to any protein from the host, represent attractive potential drug targets. We have listed out 11 such potential drug targets which are playing some important work in more than one pathway. Out of these, one important target is Glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme; it plays crucial part in oxidation reduction, metabolic process and amino acid metabolic process. As this is also present in the targets of tropical diseases of TDR (Tropical disease related Drug) target database and no PDB and MODBASE 3D structural model is available, homology models for Glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme were generated using MODELLER9v6. The model was further explored for the molecular dynamics simulation study with GROMACS, virtual screening and docking studies with suitable inhibitors against the NCI diversity subset molecules from ZINC database, by using AutoDock-Vina.

Further the Complexes were analyzed through LIGPLOT. On the basis of Complex scoring and binding ability it is deciphered that these NCI diversity set II compounds, specifically ZINC01690699 (as it has minimum energy score and one of the highest number of interactions with the active site residue), could be promising inhibitors for T. gondii using Glutamate dehydrogenase as Drug target.},

abstract = {Among CYPs, CYP2A sub-family is well known for its function to metabolize xenobiotics. CYP2A includes three members: CYP2A6, CYP2A7 and CYP2A13. Of these three proteins, structure and function of CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 are widely studied whereas very little study has been carried out on CYP2A7. In the initial in vitro studies on CYP2A7, full protein in its active form could not be expressed. The exact structure and function of CYP2A7 is still not revealed. However, up-regulation of CYP2A7 has been reported in malignant oesophageal cells and colon cancer cells. In the present study, we generated the structure of CYP2A7 protein. The modelled proteins were validated and subjected to molecular docking analyses. The energy and RMSD calculations demonstrated that the protein is highly conserved in nature i.e. the protein is not much flexible. Here the ligand molecules of NCI Diversity Set II from the ZINC database against the active site of the CYP2A7 protein were screened. Five compounds that possess good inhibitory activity against CYP2A7 active site were identified. The top ranking molecule (ZINC01572309) has a minimum energy score of -12.0 Kcal/Mol. This compound is thus a good starting point for further development of strong inhibitors. Our in silico approach could help in better structural and functional analysis of CYP2A7. Apart from structural description of CYP2A7, elaboration of binding sites for inhibitors provides us with an opportunity to utilize binding pockets in targeted inactivation of this protein for further research.},

abstract = {Type I polyketide synthases often use programmed $\beta$-branching, via enzymes of a 'hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HCS) cassette', to incorporate various side chains at the second carbon from the terminal carboxylic acid of growing polyketide backbones. We identified a strong sequence motif in acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) where $\beta$-branching is known to occur. Substituting ACPs confirmed a correlation of ACP type with $\beta$-branching specificity. Although these ACPs often occur in tandem, NMR analysis of tandem $\beta$-branching ACPs indicated no ACP-ACP synergistic effects and revealed that the conserved sequence motif forms an internal core rather than an exposed patch. Modeling and mutagenesis identified ACP helix III as a probable anchor point of the ACP-HCS complex whose position is determined by the core. Mutating the core affects ACP functionality, whereas ACP-HCS interface substitutions modulate system specificity. Our method for predicting $\beta$-carbon branching expands the potential for engineering new polyketides and lays a basis for determining specificity rules. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Background: We and others have identified the aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3 as a potential drug target in prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukaemia. As a consequence, significant effort is being invested in the development of AKR1C3-selective inhibitors. Methods: We report the screening of an in-house drug library to identify known drugs that selectively inhibit AKR1C3 over the closely related isoforms AKR1C1, 1C2 and 1C4. This screen initially identified tetracycline as a potential AKR1C3-selective inhibitor. However, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance studies identified that the active agent was a novel breakdown product (4-methyl(de-dimethylamine)-tetracycline (4-MDDT)). Results: We demonstrate that, although 4-MDDT enters AML cells and inhibits their AKR1C3 activity, it does not recapitulate the anti-leukaemic actions of the pan-AKR1C inhibitor medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Screens of the NCI diversity set and an independently curated small-molecule library identified several additional AKR1C3-selective inhibitors, none of which had the expected anti-leukaemic activity. However, a pan AKR1C, also identified in the NCI diversity set faithfully recapitulated the actions of MPA. Conclusions: In summary, we have identified a novel tetracycline-derived product that provides an excellent lead structure with proven drug-like qualities for the development of AKR1C3 inhibitors. However, our findings suggest that, at least in leukaemia, selective inhibition of AKR1C3 is insufficient to elicit an anticancer effect and that multiple AKR1C inhibition may be required. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cancer Research UK.

abstract = {It was over half a century ago when the overwhelming array of chemicals found in plants was postulated to be more than just by-products of primary metabolism. Ever since, extensive research has been conducted on plant secondary metabolites which are now known to be the end points of sophisticated survival mechanisms that plants have developed as a response to various kinds of stresses. Stress, defined by its negative effect on the growth and development of an individual, can be internal (metabolic or genetic), external (biotic or abiotic), permanent or acute. To cope, organisms must develop tolerance, resistance or avoidance mechanisms. Isoprenoids, often released as volatiles from plants, constitute the most diverse groups of natural products and play an essential part in plant defense systems, both directly (as emitted volatiles) and indirectly (the principle of inviting friends to feast on foes). Research over the last decade has resulted in a significant improvement in our understanding of the isoprenoid biosynthesis but there remains much to learn about the complex regulatory network controlling the various steps of these pathways and their dynamic co-ordination. Here we identify novel plant proteins and provide a putative role for them in isoprenoid based stress responses, along with insights into future perspectives for research.},

abstract = {Toll-like Receptors (TLRs); a novel class of receptors can recognize conserved motifs so called pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) predominantly found in microorganisms and initiate a cascade of cellular signaling that direct the subsequent immune responses thus act as a bridge between the innate and acquired immunity. Under the condition of co expression of TLR2 and TLR6 with the help of their agonist molecule could induce maximum NF- B through MyD-88 dependent pathway. Heterodimerization of TLR2 with TLR6 is an evolutionary process which enhances the ligand recognition capacity to enable the innate immune system. In the present study, a heterodimer of TLR2/TLR6 and a TIR-TIR platform formed by heterodimerization of TLR2/TLR6 has been produced using the computer assisted homology modelling and protein-protein docking method. Detail analysis of selected TLR2 and TLR6 docked complex and TIR-TIR docked complex helped us to find out the interacting amino acid residues between both the molecules. TLR2 and TLR6 interact with each other at three points while a Toll- interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain of both TLR2 and TLR6 interacts at single point only. These interactions are very crucial for activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine cascade and T cell proliferation to stimulate immune responses.},

Pharmacogenomic analysis deals with study how different individuals behave towards same drug or chemical. The present work examined Insilco sequence and structural differences in the isoenzymes of alcohol dehydrogenase involved in alcohol metabolism. Methods: Experiment, identified ADH1B, ADH1A, ADH1C and ADH4 as four different alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes, their sequences in the FASTA format was retrieved form uniprot knowledgedatabase. Sequence alignment, dendogram generation, motif identification, secondary structure prediction was carried out and examined with the help of different computational programs. Results: Multiple sequence alignment, Phylogenetic tree, amino acid composition, Percentage of different secondary structures reflect high degree of similarity in the results for ADH1B, ADH1A and ADH1C except there are some significant deviations in the results for ADH4. While analyzing the amino acids of active site region it was found that five out of nine amino acids are identical but four amino acid showed some variations. Ser at position 48 is replaced by Thr in ADH1B, ADH1A and ADH4. His at position 51, Ala at position 317 and Cys at position 146, is mutated with Thr in all three cases and all three mutations have occurred only in case of ADH4. Insilco analysis suggests that minimum mutations took place in the active site region of ADH1C, followed by ADH4, ADH1B and ADH1A. It can be concluded that individuals may inclined towards alcoholism either due to the absence of normal form of isoenzyme or presence of mutated form of isoenzyme (Pharmacogenomics), which is unable to perform its normal function of metabolism.},

HSV type 1 (HSV-1) more commonly causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth. HSV type 2 (HSV-2) more commonly causes genital herpes. Entry of HSV into the host cell involves interactions of several glycoproteins on the surface of the enveloped virus, with receptors on the surface of the host cell. Studies have shown that vaccination of mice with the secreted HSV 1 gD resulted in the induction of antibodies able to neutralize both HSV 1 and HSV 2 in vitro. In the present work T-cell and B-cell epitopes were predicted for glycoprotein D of HSV type-1. MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes were predicted by ProPred-I and MHC2Pred servers respectively and B-cell epitopes were predicted by ABCPred server. The three-dimensional structures of top ranked epitopes (small peptides) were modelled using the HHpred server. In order to find the most relevant epitopes among the MHC-I and MHC-II predicted epitopes; protein-protein docking studies were carried out. These predicted epitopes (small peptides) might be promising candidates for the vaccine design against HSV-1.},

Methods: Experiment, includes first to identify and generate DNA profile of the sample under investigation by using different techniques like RFLP analysis, PCR analysis, STR analysis, AmpFLP analysis, Y-Chromosome analysis, and Mitochondrial Analysis. Ones the DNA profile is generated different Bioinformatics tools like, BLASTP, BLASTN, ClustalW, Tagger, QTDT, GOLD, GRR, SNPtagger, PLINK, PHASE, Snphap, and different Biological Databases like GenBank, Expasy, CODIS, EDNAP and DNA databases are used to carry out analysis of DNA profile. Results: Analysis of DNA profile helps in establishing the match of the sample DNA profile under investigation with that of the standard one. If a match is found in the sample and standard one then on its bases it can be said that both belongs to the same person and absence of match indicated lack of similarity or relationship of sample with that of the standard one.

abstract = {To analyze differentially expressed genes in colon cancer, we compared expression profiles of colorectal cancer cells from normal colonic cells using data of DNA microarray consisting of 6584 human genes. Each probe set on the array consisted of EST (expressed sequence tag) sequence of 20 feature pairs of 25 bp sequence. The data set comprised of 61 samples, divided into two groups of 40 samples for tumor cells (Group 1) and 21 samples for normal cells (Group 2). In order to do background adjustments for the negative expression values, the data was transformed into log base 2 and estimation of missing values was performed by K-nearest neighbor method, followed by normalization using 'minimum mean ratio' among arrays. The basic statistics used for the significance analysis was J5 test, which was computed for each probe and for each contrast with a threshold value of 4.0 and mean as the measure of central tendency. The differentially expressed genes were expressed at high frequency in tumour samples. The Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm was used to test defined classification of samples of genes. Correlation distance was measured with the help of Pearson's correlation distance. On the basis of J5 test scores, top 5 upregulated genes, viz., vasopressin-neurophysin 2-copeptin preproprotein, cytochrome, P450 2A7 isoform, major centromere autoantigen B, myelin associated glycoprotein and bone morphogenetic protein 1 isoform 3 precursor, were selected for further analysis. The above said genes have not yet been reported to be differentially overexpressed in colon cancer cells, while their overexpression was reported in other cancers, such as, lung and breast cancer, etc. These genes can be used for prediction and analyses of the gene products, which will help in designing new diagnostic and treatment strategies for the colon cancer.},

abstract = {The enzyme catalase breaks down H2O2, a potentially harmful oxidant, to H2O and O2. Besides oxidase activity, the enzyme also exhibits peroxidase activity. Therefore, it plays an important role in maintaining health and regulating pathophysiology of the organisms. However, 3D structure of this important enzyme in invertebrates particularly in crabs is not yet available. Therefore, an attempt has been made to predict the structure of the crab catalase and to envisage its catalytic interaction with H2O2. A three dimensional model of crab catalase was constructed using the NADPH binding site on Beef Liver catalase from Bos taurus (PDBID: 7CAT) as template by comparative modeling approach. Backbone conformation of the modeled structure by PROCHECK revealed that more than 98{\%} of the residues fell in the allowed regions, ERRAT results confirmed good quality of modeled structure and VERIFY3D profile was satisfying. Molecular docking has been used to know the binding modes of hydrogen peroxide with the crab catalase protein. The receptor structures used for docking were derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of homology modeled structure. The docking results showed that the three important determinant residues Arg68, Val70 and Arg108 in catalase were binding with H2O2 as they had strong hydrogen bonding contacts with the substrate. Our analysis provides insight into the structural properties of crab catalase and defines its active sites for binding with substrate. These data are important for further studies of catalase of invertebrates in general and that of crabs in particular. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The precise function of Rab3A is still not known. However, up-regulation of Rab3A has been reported in malignant neuroendocrine and breast cancer cells. In the present study, the structure of Rab3A protein was generated using MODELLER 9v8 software. The modeled protein structure was validated and subjected to molecular docking analyses. Docking with GTP was carried out on the binding site of Rab3A using GOLD software. The Rab3A-GTP complex has best GOLD fitness value of 77.73. Ligplot shows hydrogen bondings (S16, S17, V18, G19, K20, T21, S22, S31, T33, A35, S38, T39 and G65) and hydrophobic interacting residues (F25, F32, P34, F36, V37, D62 and A64) with the GTP ligands in the binding site of Rab3A protein. Here, the ligand molecules of NCI diversity set II from the ZINC database against the active site of the Rab3A protein were screened. For this purpose, the incremental construction algorithm of GLIDE and the genetic algorithm of GOLD were used. Docking results were analyzed for top ranking compounds using a consensus scoring function of X-Score to calculate the binding affinity and Ligplot was used to measure protein-ligand interactions. Five compounds which possess good inhibitory activity and may act as potential high affinity inhibitors against Rab3A active site were identified. The top ranking molecule (ZINC13152284) has a Glide score of -6.65 kcal/mol, X-Score of -3.02 kcal/mol and GOLD score of 64.54 with 03 hydrogen bonds and 09 hydrophobic contacts.

Chickpea is a premier food legume crop with high nutritional quality and attains prime importance in the current era of 795 million people being undernourished worldwide. Chickpea production encounters setbacks due to various stresses and understanding the role of key transcription factors (TFs) involved in multiple stresses becomes inevitable. We have recently identified a multi-stress responsive WRKY TF in chickpea. The present study was conducted to predict the structure of WRKY TF to identify the DNA-interacting residues and decipher DNA-protein interactions. Comparative modelling approach produced 3D model of the WRKY TF with good stereochemistry, local/global quality and further revealed W19, R20, K21, and Y22 motifs within a vicinity of 5 {\AA} to the DNA amongst R18, G23, Q24, K25, Y36, Y37, R38 and K47 and these positions were equivalent to the 2LEX WRKY domain of Arabidopsis. Molecular simulations analysis of reference protein -PDB ID 2LEX, along with Car-WRKY TF modelled structure with the DNA coordinates derived from PDB ID 2LEX and docked using HADDOCK were executed. Root Mean Square (RMS) Deviation and RMS Fluctuation values yielded consistently stable trajectories over 50 ns simulation. Strengthening the obtained results, neither radius of gyration, distance and total energy showed any signs of DNA-WRKY complex falling apart nor any significant dissociation event over 50 ns run. Therefore, the study provides first insights into the structural properties of multi-stress responsive WRKY TF-DNA complex in chickpea, enabling genome wide identification of TF binding sites and thereby deciphers their gene regulatory networks.},

Molecular docking tool was used to elucidate a comparative binding mode of the crab and rat SOD with potent inhibitors of SOD such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium cyanide (KCN) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The predicted valid structure of crab MnSOD did not show any interaction with KCN but close interaction with H2O2 and SDS. A possible inhibitory mechanism of SDS and H2O2 due to their interaction with the amino acids present in the active site of the MnSOD of the above two animals are elucidated. This allowed us to predict the binding modes of the proteins to elucidate probable mode of action and sites of interference. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Among CYPs, CYP2A sub-family is well known for its function to metabolise xenobiotics. CYP2A includes three members: CYP2A6, CYP2A7 and CYP2A13. Of these three proteins, structure and function of CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 are widely studied, whereas very little study has been carried out on CYP2A7. In the initial in vitro studies on CYP2A7, full protein in its active form could not be expressed. The exact structure and function of CYP2A7 is still not revealed. However, up-regulation of CYP2A7 has been reported in malignant oesophageal cells and colon cancer cells. In the present study, we generated the structure of CYP2A7 protein. The modelled proteins were validated and subjected to molecular docking analyses. The energy and RMSD calculations demonstrated that the protein is highly conserved in nature, i.e., the protein is not much flexible. Here the ligand molecules of NCI Diversity Set II from the ZINC database against the active site of the CYP2A7 protein were screened. Five compounds that possess good inhibitory activity against CYP2A7 active site were identified. The top ranking molecule (ZINC01572309) has a minimum energy score of −12.0 kcal/Mol. This compound is thus a good starting point for further development of strong inhibitors. Our in silico approach could help in better structural and functional analysis of CYP2A7. Apart from structural description of CYP2A7, elaboration of binding sites for inhibitors provides us with an opportunity to utilise binding pockets in targeted inactivation of this protein for further research.},

Science is slowly unlocking the secrets of the exquisite chemical synthesis capabilities of polyketide synthases (PKSs), as well as other secondary metabolites' biosynthesis pathways, and learning to re-engineer such pathways to synthesize novel chemical compounds. Research over the last 30 years has involved innovative experiments and bioinformatics focused on a wide range of medicinal compounds ranging from antibiotics to anticholesterol agents. Furthermore, it has been possible to manipulate PKSs to produce novel compounds for pharmaceutical use. However, despite great progress, our knowledge is still sketchy, and experiments continue to be time-consuming and difficult. PKSs, and secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in general, provide model systems for developing and testing experimental and bioinformatic tools for synthetic biology application. Bioinformatic and molecular modelling are important for making sense of existing and future experimental data. Bioinformatic and structural modelling can help in several ways: by predicting how manipulations of protein domains might yield viable novel biosynthetic pathways to generate variants of existing chemicals/pharmaceuticals of high value or to allow the synthesis of totally novel compounds, by assisting the discovery of novel gene clusters in genomic and metagenomic data, by predicting the metabolites synthesized by novel gene clusters and by interpreting experimental data to elucidate the rules governing polyketide synthase function, which feeds back into the others on this list.},

We computationally define cell populations using FlowSOM clustering, and facilitate an optional but reproducible strategy for manual merging of algorithm-generated clusters. Our workflow offers different analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with a phenotype or changes in signaling markers within specific subpopulations, or differential analyses of aggregated signals. Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response; thus, we are able to model arbitrary experimental designs, such as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing overdispersion in cell count or aggregated signals across samples to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step, including quality control (e.g. multi-dimensional scaling plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses (e.g. plots of aggregated signals).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We identified changes in amino acid, lipid and nucleotide metabolism pathways, providing evidence for anti-inflammatory metabolomic changes in TB. Metabolic profiles indicate increased activity of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), decreased phospholipase activity, increased abundance of adenosine metabolism products, as well as indicators of fibrotic lesions in active disease as compared to latent infection. Consistent with our predictions, we experimentally demonstrate TB-induced IDO1 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a link between metabolic profiles and cytokine signaling.

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

abstract = {Mass cytometry or CyTOF is an emerging technology for high-dimensional multiparameter single cell analysis that overcomes many limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry. New methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and interpretation of data generated in large studies. However, most current tools are less suitable for routine use where analysis must be standardized, reproducible, interpretable, and comparable. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps untenable for larger studies. The subjectivity of manual gating introduces variability into the data and impacts reproducibility and comparability of results, particularly in multi-center studies. The FlowCAP consortium was formed to address these issues and it aims to boost user confidence in the viability of automated gating methods. We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating based on a multi-autoencoder neural network. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between a source domain distribution (reference sample) and multiple target domain distributions (target samples) in a supervised manner. We apply DeepCyTOF to two CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i) 14 subjects with a history of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), and (ii) 34 healthy subjects of different ages. Each blood sample was labeled with 42 antibody markers, 12 of which were used in our analysis, at baseline and three different stimuli (PMA/ionomycin, tumor cell line K562, and infection with WNV). In each of these datasets we manually gated a single baseline reference sample to automatically gate the remaining uncalibrated samples. We show that DeepCyTOF cell classification is highly concordant with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating of each sample with over 99{\%} concordance. Additionally, we apply a stacked autoencoder, which is one of the building blocks of DeepCyTOF, to cytometry datasets used in the 4th challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition and demonstrate that it over performs relative to all gating methods introduced in this competition. We conclude that stacked autoencoders combined with a domain adaptation procedure offers a powerful computational approach for semi-automated gating of CyTOF and flow cytometry data such that manual gating of one reference sample is sufficient for accurately gating the remaining samples.},

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records.

abstract = {High-dimensional flow and mass cytometry allow cell types and states to be characterized in great detail by measuring expression levels of more than 40 targeted protein markers per cell at the single-cell level. However, data analysis can be difficult, due to the large size and dimensionality of datasets as well as limitations of existing computational methods. Here, we present diffcyt, a new computational framework for differential discovery analyses in high-dimensional cytometry data, based on a combination of high-resolution clustering and empirical Bayes moderated tests adapted from transcriptomics. Our approach provides improved statistical performance, including for rare cell populations, along with flexible experimental designs and fast runtimes in an open-source framework.},

@book{Dunn2018,
abstract = {This textbook presents an introduction to multiple linear regression, providing real-world data sets and practice problems. A practical working knowledge of applied statistical practice is developed through the use of these data sets and numerous case studies. The authors include a set of practice problems both at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book. Each example in the text is cross-referenced with the relevant data set, so that readers can load the data and follow the analysis in their own R sessions. The balance between theory and practice is evident in the list of problems, which vary in difficulty and purpose. This book is designed with teaching and learning in mind, featuring chapter introductions and summaries, exercises, short answers, and simple, clear examples. Focusing on the connections between generalized linear models (GLMs) and linear regression, the book also references advanced topics and tools that have not typically been included in introductions to GLMs to date, such as Tweedie family distributions with power variance functions, saddlepoint approximations, likelihood score tests, modified profile likelihood, and randomized quantile residuals. In addition, the authors introduce the new R code package, GLMsData, created specifically for this book. Generalized Linear Models with Examples in R balances theory with practice, making it ideal for both introductory and graduate-level students who have a basic knowledge of matrix algebra, calculus, and statistics.},

abstract = {Context Many shorebirds are threatened by human-caused disturbance. For$\backslash$nsnowy plovers, disturbance within nesting habitats has been implicated$\backslash$nas a major contributing factor in their population decline through$\backslash$ndeleterious effects on breeding success. Very little is known about site$\backslash$nspecificity of disturbance from human activities for this species.$\backslash$nAims We examined the disturbance of incubating snowy plovers to$\backslash$ndetermine if nesting shorebirds within one breeding population exhibited$\backslash$nsite-specific patterns of disturbance from human activities.$\backslash$nMethods We recorded flush (i.e. flight or escape from a perceived$\backslash$nthreat) distances and time spent off the nest following approach by a$\backslash$nsingle person on Sanibel and Cayo Costa Islands, two islands in$\backslash$nsouth-west Florida that differ in daily human visitation, and by a$\backslash$nperson walking a dog on Sanibel. We used a Bayesian model framework to$\backslash$ndetermine effects of location and approach type on flush distance and$\backslash$ntime spent off of the nest.$\backslash$nKey results Birds nesting on Sanibel flushed at shorter distances from a$\backslash$nsolitary person without a dog than did birds nesting on Cayo Costa, but$\backslash$nspent similar amounts of time off of nests following a flush. On$\backslash$nSanibel, nesting birds also flushed at significantly greater distances$\backslash$nand spent significantly more time off of nests when flushed by a person$\backslash$nwalking a dog rather than by a person alone.$\backslash$nConclusions Within a population, nesting snowy plovers exhibit site- and$\backslash$nstimulus-dependent patterns of disturbance. The intraspecific variation$\backslash$nfalls within the range of variation recorded among species of birds$\backslash$nstudied elsewhere. Although we cannot determine causation, we suggest$\backslash$nhabituation to human activities from a combination of high beach usage,$\backslash$nsmaller nesting exclusion zones, and narrower beach width on Sanibel$\backslash$ncompared to Cayo Costa as a likely explanation for this difference.$\backslash$nImplications Set-back distances for symbolic fencing have been$\backslash$ngeneralised across species and nesting locations. Our results suggest$\backslash$nthat disturbance of nesting shorebirds can be site-dependent even within$\backslash$none breeding population of a species. Set-back distances around$\backslash$nshorebird nests must account for location and types of activities$\backslash$nencountered, implying the need for more conservative implementation of$\backslash$nset-back distances.},

abstract = {Mass cytometry has revolutionized the study of cellular and phenotypic diversity, significantly expanding the number of phenotypic and functional characteristics that can be measured at the single-cell level. This high-dimensional analysis platform has necessitated the development of new data analysis approaches. Many of these algorithms circumvent traditional approaches used in flow cytometric analysis, fundamentally changing the way these data are analyzed and interpreted. For the beginner, however, the large number of algorithms that have been developed, as well as the lack of consensus on best practices for analyzing these data, raise multiple questions: Which algorithm is the best for analyzing a dataset? How do different algorithms compare? How can one move beyond data visualization to gain new biological insights? In this article, we describe our experiences as recent adopters of mass cytometry. By analyzing a single dataset using five cytometry by time-of-flight analysis platforms (viSNE, SPADE, X-shift, PhenoGraph, and Citrus), we identify important considerations and challenges that users should be aware of when using these different methods and common and unique insights that can be revealed by these different methods. By providing annotated workflow and figures, these analyses present a practical guide for investigators analyzing high-dimensional datasets. In total, these analyses emphasize the benefits of integrating multiple cytometry by time-of-flight analysis algorithms to gain complementary insights into these high-dimensional datasets.},

We explored the population dynamics of genetically diverse GC responses to two complex antigens-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen and influenza hemagglutinin-in which B cells competed both intra- and interclonally for distinct epitopes. Preferred VH rearrangements among antigen-binding, naive B cells were similarly abundant in early GCs but, unlike responses to haptens, clonal diversity increased in GC B cells as early "winners" were replaced by rarer, high-affinity clones. Despite affinity maturation, inter- and intraclonal avidities varied greatly, and half of GC B cells did not bind the immunogen but nonetheless exhibited biased VH use, V(D)J mutation, and clonal expansion comparable to antigen-binding cells. GC reactions to complex antigens permit a range of specificities and affinities, with potential advantages for broad protection.},

@article{Rohloff2014,
abstract = {Limited chemical diversity of nucleic acid libraries has long been suspected to be a major constraining factor in the overall success of SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment). Despite this constraint, SELEX has enjoyed considerable success over the past quarter of a century as a result of the enormous size of starting libraries and conformational richness of nucleic acids. With judicious introduction of functional groups absent in natural nucleic acids, the "diversity gap" between nucleic acid-based ligands and protein-based ligands can be substantially bridged, to generate a new class of ligands that represent the best of both worlds. We have explored the effect of various functional groups at the 5-position of uracil and found that hydrophobic aromatic side chains have the most profound influence on the success rate of SELEX and allow the identification of ligands with very low dissociation rate constants (named Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers or SOMAmers). Such modified nucleotides create unique intramolecular motifs and make direct contacts with proteins. Importantly, SOMAmers engage their protein targets with surfaces that have significantly more hydrophobic character compared with conventional aptamers, thereby increasing the range of epitopes that are available for binding. These improvements have enabled us to build a collection of SOMAmers to over 3,000 human proteins encompassing major families such as growth factors, cytokines, enzymes, hormones, and receptors, with additional SOMAmers aimed at pathogen and rodent proteins. Such a large and growing collection of exquisite affinity reagents expands the scope of possible applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.},

Systems biology approaches have been used to determine signatures that can be used to predict vaccine-induced immunity in humans, but whether there is a 'universal signature' that can be used to predict antibody responses to any vaccine is unknown. Here we did systems analyses of immune responses to the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines against meningococcus in healthy adults, in the broader context of published studies of vaccines against yellow fever virus and influenza virus. To achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. Our results elucidate the early transcriptional programs that orchestrate vaccine immunity in humans and demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling.},

Thus, to be successful, the Human Immunology Project will require standardized assays for immunophenotyping humans in health and disease.

@article{Candia2019,
abstract = {Regularized generalized linear models (GLMs) are popular regression methods in bioinformatics, particularly useful in scenarios with fewer observations than parameters/features or when many of the features are correlated. In both ridge and lasso regularization, feature shrinkage is controlled by a penalty parameter $\lambda$. The elastic net introduces a mixing parameter $\alpha$ to tune the shrinkage continuously from ridge to lasso. Selecting $\alpha$ objectively and determining which features contributed significantly to prediction after model fitting remain a practical challenge given the paucity of available software to evaluate performance and statistical significance. eNetXplorer builds on top of glmnet to address the above issues for linear (Gaussian), binomial (logistic), and multinomial GLMs. It provides new functionalities to empower practical applications by using a cross validation framework that assesses the predictive performance and statistical significance of a family of elastic net models (as $\alpha$ is varied) and of the corresponding features that contribute to prediction. The user can select which quality metrics to use to quantify the concordance between predicted and observed values, with defaults provided for each GLM. Statistical significance for each model (as defined by $\alpha$) is determined based on comparison to a set of null models generated by random permutations of the response; the same permutation-based approach is used to evaluate the significance of individual features. In the analysis of large and complex biological datasets, such as transcriptomic and proteomic data, eNetXplorer provides summary statistics, output tables, and visualizations to help assess which subset(s) of features have predictive value for a set of response measurements, and to what extent those subset(s) of features can be expanded or reduced via regularization. This package presents a framework and software for exploratory data analysis and visualization. By making regularized GLMs more accessible and interpretable, eNetXplorer guides the process to generate hypotheses based on features significantly associated with biological phenotypes of interest, e.g. to identify biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness. eNetXplorer is also generally applicable to any research area that may benefit from predictive modeling and feature identification using regularized GLMs. The package is available under GPL-3 license at the CRAN repository, https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eNetXplorer .},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.
